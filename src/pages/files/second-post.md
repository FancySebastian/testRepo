WhatsApp must police itself more proactively in India, where misuse of its services has taken a toll.

Union Minister for Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad has told Chris Daniels, the new CEO of WhatsApp, that he expects better compliance and more responsible oversight of traffic from the messenger, which is owned by Facebook and has over 200 million users in India. Over the last few months, WhatsApp has served as a dis-information superhighway for viral rumours and campaigns that could be said to have played a role in incidents of lynching. It would have come under severe pressure if it had allowed its services to be misused with such malevolent intent in a Western market, and the Indian government has a right to expect it to conduct its business more responsibly. Prasad has warned that its lack of proactive will can be read as abetment, and in the role of law minister, has promised legal action if it chooses to remain a bystander.
