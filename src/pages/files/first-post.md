The Lok Sabha gave its unanimous approval to the Constitution (Forty- fifth Amendment) Bill amidst thunderous applause from all sides.The historic measure seeks to remove the obnoxious provisions inducted into the Constitution during the Emergency. The bill was passed with the massive support of 355 members and none opposing it. In the words of a smiling law minister, Shanti Bhushan, who piloted the bill, the measure would re-frame the Constitution in such a manner as it would the people to safeguard their rights and pave the way for a more glorious future for them.
