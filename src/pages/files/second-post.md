# Fact Fighting

GDP growth rates were never the stuff of Indian politics, until recently. A growth rate of 10 per cent, in particular, is a red rag to the bull. But we have been there before. The last real year of Rajiv Gandhi’s rule, 1988-89, saw GDP in constant prices record a 10.5 per cent growth. I say “real” because it was an election year. It is not a catastrophe that 10 per cent plus growth was achieved by Rajiv Gandhi and a Congress government. The number “10” seems a psychological divide and it is quite likely that 9.8 would have not led to the same flurry.
