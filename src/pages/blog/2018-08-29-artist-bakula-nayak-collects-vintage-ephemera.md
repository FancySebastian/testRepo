In a bill book that dates back to 1907, a man maintains a personal journal. With a note on the weather, he talks about the day’s activities, but doesn’t express his feelings. Artist Bakula Nayak found some pages of this diary in a quaint vintage store in Minneapolis, US, and decided to keep them. In it, she read a line: ‘Wife is here…fun evah since Tuesday’. “For such an impersonal journal, this sentence is particularly intimate as I saw a side of him that made him real,” says Nayak, who has painted a pair of lovelorn flamingos on the pages as an ode to their relationship. These paintings, with vintage ephemera and photographs, are a part of Nayak’s first solo exhibition, ‘Intimate Strangers’, organised by Artisera, an online marketplace for art and collectibles. In her previous show ‘Sangam (Unplugged)’, she responded to Sangam poetry through her paintings, while musician Sushma Somasekharan sang along.
